a YAML file (`fc_settings.yaml`) rather than hard-coded in the example, so a

    How soft the winch is [-].

    WHAT IT SCALES. In force mode the drum holds a low-passed reference force,
    and a load above that reference stretches the length trim like a spring: the
    steady-state yield is dF / winch_len_kp, so the compliance IS 1/winch_len_kp
    [m/N]. The knob divides both `winch_len_kp` and `winch_damp`
    (`data/wc_settings.yaml`) by `compliance`, so yield scales linearly with it
    while their ratio — the length loop's own time constant — is left alone. The
    result is a softer or stiffer winch of the SAME character, not a different
    one. `winch_force_tau` is untouched: that sets WHICH frequencies the drum
    yields to, not by how much. Values above 1.0 are meaningful (2.0 = twice as
    soft); the useful range is bounded by the runaway recorded in
    `data/wc_settings.yaml`, where force mode with no damping at all lost the
    run at t = 19.8 s.

    AT EXACTLY 0 the controller changes, because an infinitely stiff spring is
    not representable: the run switches to POSITION mode (`set_length = l0`)
    with `winch_ff_scale = 1.0`, where the holding torque cancels the measured
    load exactly and the drum sees nothing to accelerate it — 0.009 m of travel
    over a 30 s run, i.e. a constant unstretched tether length. The limit is
    continuous in BEHAVIOUR (`compliance` 0.01 already means winch_len_kp =
    10 kN/m) but not in code path, so a sweep should not expect the two sides to
    agree to the millimeter. Note the default `winch_ff_scale` of 0.7 is NOT
