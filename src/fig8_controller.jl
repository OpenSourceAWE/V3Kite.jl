Figure-of-eight path-following guidance for the V3 kite.

Implements the attractor-point ("L0") guidance of Fernandes et al., Energies
2022 (doi:10.3390/en15041390): the closest point Q on the reference path to the
kite defines the cross-track error d; the attractor point R lies a fixed arc
distance (`attractor_distance`, in degrees) ahead of Q along the path. The outer
steers towards R by great-circle navigation (course `chi_set`), which a heading
PID then tracks. Unlike L1 logic, the L0 attractor is well defined at any
distance from the path, so no controller switching or approach logic is needed.

The reference path is a lemniscate in (azimuth, elevation), both in degrees.

# Sign and frame conventions (measured, see PlanFig8.md STEP 0)

Verified against `data/tmp_steering.arrow` and `data/tmp_sinus.arrow`
(`system_reelout.yaml`, v_wind 9.51 m/s):

- **Positive `rel_steering` produces a positive heading rate** (correlation
  +0.998 between tape position `sl.steering` and the frame-transport-corrected
  turn rate). The heading PID output is therefore fed to `rel_steering`
  *unnegated*, as in `examples/simple_auto_parking.jl`. (The branch for the
  other kite negates; that does not transfer.)
- **The course computed from the (azimuth, elevation) trace in this module's
  convention matches `SysState.heading`**: same zero, same sign, circular-mean
  offset +13.3° with a 7.6° spread over the samples where the kite actually
  flies (>2°/s). No `neg_azimuth`, no π correction is needed anywhere in this
  file. The +13° is the kite's real course-minus-heading drift angle — the
  guidance commands a *course* while the inner loop regulates *heading*, so a
  small steady-state cross-track bias is expected and is what the heading PID's
  integral term absorbs.

Bearing convention throughout: `0` = towards zenith, positive towards larger
azimuth.

# Turn-rate feasibility

The identified turn-rate law of the V3 (`identify_turn_rate_law` on
`tmp_steering`) is `ψ̇ = c1·v_a·u_s + c2/v_a·sin(ψ)·cos(β)`; `c1` depends on both
`body_damping` and `depower` — see [`V3_TURN_RATE_COEFFS`](@ref) and always look
it up with [`turn_rate_coeffs`](@ref) for the settings actually flown. The
minimum angular turn radius the kite can fly on the sphere follows from `ρ = (v/L)/(c1·v·u_s) = 1/(L·c1·u_s)` — note the
apparent wind speed cancels, so it depends only on tether length and steering
authority. Use [`min_turn_radius`](@ref) and [`path_min_radius`](@ref) to check
a candidate pattern against it *before* running a simulation; a pattern whose
tightest curvature is smaller than `ρ` cannot be flown however the PID is tuned.

arc ahead of Q along the path, and the cross-track error.

Near the self-intersection of the figure-of-eight two path branches are (almost)
equally close. Two mechanisms keep Q on the right one:

1. **Continuity** (`search_window`): Q is searched only within a window of arc
   around the previous Q, so it advances along the path instead of teleporting
   to the far branch. This is the primary guard — without it the commanded
   course flips by ~180° each time the kite crosses the self-intersection, which
   slams the steering across and, on the V3, broke the model outright (a run
   diverged at t=13.3 s with `chi_set` jumping 90.6° -> -97.5°). The window is
   dropped whenever the kite is further than `reacquire_dist` from the path, so
   a genuinely off-path kite re-acquires globally.
2. **Flight direction** (`branch_tol`): among the remaining near-equal
   candidates, the branch whose tangent needs the smaller heading change wins.

Useful as an entry reference when the kite is far from the path. The great-circle

above the pattern — every attractor point is then ~"straight down", so `chi_set`
collapses onto the ±180° branch cut and its *sign* is numerical noise. The
tangent at Q has no such degeneracy (it is ~±108° from a 73° park above a
pattern centred at 30°) and additionally encodes which way round the path is
traversed, so an entry flown along it arrives moving in the right direction.
