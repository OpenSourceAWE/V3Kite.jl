Headless quantitative metrics for figure-of-eight runs (see
`examples/simple_fig8.jl` and the success criteria in PlanFig8.md). Ported from
an earlier `fig8_metrics.jl`, adapted to the V3 log layout:

- `set_steering` is dimensionless `rel_steering` here, not meters, so the
  high-frequency content is reported in rel-steering units — establish a V3
  baseline rather than importing the earlier thresholds.
- the V3 has one winch, logged in `winch_force[1]`.
- `var_01` carries the cross-track error [deg] (see `simple_fig8.jl` for the
  full slot mapping).

No plotting dependency, so this runs in headless sweeps.
"""

"""
    fig8_metrics(sl; t_start=0.0, settle_time=10.0, hf_window=0.5)

Compute figure-of-eight quality metrics of syslog `sl` over the settled window
(`t_start + settle_time` to the end). `hf_window` [s] is the moving-average
width subtracted out to isolate high-frequency content. Returns `nothing` if the
window is empty.

The elevation floor is reported both over the settled window and over the
**whole run** (`min_elevation_all`) — the latter is the success criterion,
because a floor breach during the entry transient still counts as a breach.

`az_amplitude`/`el_height` are the REFERENCE path's own `A` and `B` [deg]
(azimuth spans `±A`, elevation spans `B` peak to peak). Pass them and the
metrics also report **how much of the commanded pattern was actually flown**:
`az_reach_pos`/`az_reach_neg` (mean per-lobe azimuth extreme, one value per
completed excursion to that side) and the fill fractions
`az_fill_pos`/`az_fill_neg`/`el_fill`. Without them the flown extent is still
reported, the fractions are `NaN`, and the lap band falls back to its old
self-normalized form. This closes a real hole in the criteria: cross-track error
is measured against the closest point of the path, so a kite flying a small
eight, or one lobe's worth of pattern in half the wind window, can score a low
RMS `d` — it is close to the path, just not going anywhere on it. Only the reach
distinguishes "tracking the pattern" from "tracking a piece of it".

Steering is reported on BOTH sides of the actuator, and the pair is the point:
`steering_sat_frac`/`max_steering_used` describe the command, while
`tape_rate_frac`/`max_steering_delivered` describe what the KCU tape actually
did. `v_steering` [1/s] is the tape's rate limit and must match the `kcu:`
section of the settings YAML in use (0.2 for every V3 settings file shipped
here); it is a keyword rather than a constant so a log from a differently
configured KCU can still be scored correctly.

[`fig8_metrics`](@ref) plus a human-readable summary and a pass/fail line

the verdict merged in (`criteria`, the number checked, and `criteria_failed`,
the names of those that failed), or `nothing`, with a `@warn`, if unavailable.

Pass `az_amplitude`/`el_height` (the path's `A` and `B` [deg]) to also check the
pattern's SIZE: the tracking criteria are all relative to the closest point of
the path and are therefore blind to a kite flying a small eight, or one that
sits in half the wind window — both are close to the path at every instant. The
extra criteria require the mean per-lobe azimuth reach on BOTH sides, and the
elevation span, to be at least `min_span_frac` of what was commanded. They are
skipped (and the pass count drops accordingly) when the geometry is not given.
