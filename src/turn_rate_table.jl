Interpolated lookup for the V3 turn-rate-law coefficients `c1`, `c2` and
steering `delay`, backed by `data/turn_rate_coeffs.yaml` rather than a
hand-maintained `Dict` (see PlanC1C2.md). Kept in its own file, included before
`fig8_controller.jl`, because it owns state — the loaded table and the
active-run conditions stash — that the guidance code does not need to know
about.

The table is read once, at package load (`__init__`), not on every

in the same file — is not immune to a bad re-identification (this happened once
in practice: a re-run replaced a working legacy row with a solver-divergence
`outcome = "error"` row for exactly this combination, and the naive version of
this function let that exception propagate out of `__init__`, which would have
made every future `using V3Kite` fail outright). If that lookup throws, this
function only warns and leaves `V3_TURN_RATE_C1`/`C2` at their previous value
(or `NaN` before the first successful load) rather than taking the whole
package down with it — a data-quality problem in one grid cell must never
become a load-time failure. `turn_rate_coeffs` itself still throws normally for
any *other* caller asking for that same combination, since it has no equally
safe fallback value to return.

    turn_rate_coeffs(body_damping, depower; interpolate=true) -> (; c1, c2, delay, interpolated)

Look up the V3 turn-rate-law coefficients for a given `body_damping` and
`depower_setpoint`, from `data/turn_rate_coeffs.yaml`
([`V3_TURN_RATE_COEFFS`](@ref) shows its grid points).

- An exact `(body_damping, depower)` hit returns that row's values unchanged,
  `interpolated = false` — including a *legacy* row (one identified at
  conditions that no longer match the table's, e.g. a different tether length),
  with a one-time warning naming the mismatch. A row whose own identification
  did not pass (`outcome` other than `:sweep_done`/`:time_limit`, or too much
  scatter) throws instead of returning it — a failed sweep is recorded, never
  looked up as if it were data.
- Between two grid points *of the same `body_damping`*, `c1` is interpolated
  log-linearly (it decays close to exponentially with depower) and `c2`/`delay`
  linearly; `delay` is then rounded up to a multiple of the identification
  `dt`, so an interpolated dead time is never optimistic. Legacy and
  non-passing rows are never used as neighbours. `interpolate = false` disables
  this and throws instead.
- Outside the identified depower range for that damping, or for a
  `body_damping` with no rows at all, this **throws** rather than
  extrapolating or guessing — re-identify with `steering_test_v3.jl` +
  [`identify_turn_rate_law`](@ref), or run `examples/build_turn_rate_table.jl`,
  and add the row.

**Both arguments matter.** Depowering 0.25 → 0.55 costs a factor 2.95 of
steering authority *and* raises the steering dead time from 0.03 s to 0.55 s —
comparable in size to the damping effect, and easy to forget because depower is
normally thought of as a trim setting rather than a control-authority one. Body
damping is not interpolated across (see PlanC1C2.md Correction 1): it is a
3-vector with a violently nonlinear effect on `c1`, so a `body_damping` with no
identified rows throws rather than guessing from a nearby one.
