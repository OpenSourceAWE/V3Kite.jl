Figure-of-eight path following of the V3 kite via the `init`/`step!` interface.

The kite starts parked at ~73° and reaches the pattern through a four-phase
entry (park -> dive -> hold -> fig8). Once engaged, the L0
attractor guidance (`src/fig8_controller.jl`) commands a course and a PID (as in
`simple_sinus.jl` / `simple_auto_parking.jl`) tracks it with the steering tape.

# Why the pattern is large

Neither is a free choice. The V3's identified turn-rate law fixes the smallest
angular turn radius the kite can fly:

    rho = 1 / (L * c1 * u_s)        [rad]   -- apparent wind speed cancels

`c1` depends strongly on the `body_damping` passed to `init` (see
`V3_TURN_RATE_COEFFS`): across the identified range it changes the achievable
turn radius by 5.6x, from 6.9° at `[0, 0, 40]` to 38.5° at `[20, 20, 40]`. 

The tightest curvature of a lemniscate in (azimuth, elevation) is not at the
lobe tip but on the lobe's upper shoulder, and it collapses as the pattern is
raised, because the azimuth axis is compressed by `cos(elevation)`. At
`c1 = 0.3159` and `u_s = 0.175`:

    A=45 B=20, centre 73° -> tightest path radius  0.4°   (margin 0.06)
    A=45 B=20, centre 60° ->                       3.1°   (margin 0.45)
    A=45 B=20, centre 35° ->                       8.5°   (margin 1.23)
    A=50 B=25, centre 30° ->                      10.5°   (margin 1.52)

So a figure-eight near zenith is geometrically impossible for this kite at any
PID tuning: the pattern must be flown low and wide, and the kite descends onto
it. `check_pattern_feasible` prints the margin at startup. Below ~1 the tracking
error is curvature-limited and no PID tuning will fix it — enlarge the pattern,
lower its centre, lower the damping, or raise `max_steering`.

Logs the run to "fig8_run" (a dedicated name, not the shared "tmp_run"). For
verification run `include("examples/simple_fig8.jl")` — even a 30 s simulation
is several thousand `step!` calls and takes minutes of wall time. The script
`include`s `simple_fig8_plots.jl` itself at the end, so the pattern and
time-series figures come up without a second call.

Log slot mapping (`step!` already fills `var_14`/`var_15`/`var_16`):

| slot     | quantity                                  |
|:---------|:------------------------------------------|
| `var_01` | cross-track error d [deg]                 |
| `var_02` | attractor azimuth [deg]                   |
| `var_03` | attractor elevation [deg]                 |
| `var_04` | pattern-centre elevation [deg]            |
| `var_05` | raw guidance course chi_set [rad]         |
| `var_06` | regulated error (feedback - chi_cmd) [deg] |
| `var_07` | entry descent limiter weight (0 = raw guidance, 1 = fully limited) |
| `var_08` | course/heading blend weight (0 = heading, 1 = course) |
| `var_09` | span-mean geometric AoA [deg]             |

`bearing` carries `chi_cmd`, the course the loop actually tracks, so
`course - bearing` is the path-following error; the unmodified guidance course
is kept in `var_05`. The feedback angle the PID regulates is heading at low
kite speed and course at high (`v_kite_heading`/`v_kite_course`, scheduled on
`|vel_kite|`), so `var_06` equals `heading - bearing` at low speed and
`course - bearing` at high. In FIG8 mode that schedule is bypassed and the
course is fed back at any speed (`fig8_pure_course`), so `var_08` is 1
throughout phase 3 and the schedule governs the entry only.

The `sys_state` field carries the ENTRY STATE MACHINE (0 park, 1 dive, 2 hold,
3 fig8), using the same codes as the reference controller's log so both can be
read with the same scripts; `simple_fig8_plots.jl` draws it as the bottom panel
of the time-series figure.

# Parameters

Every tuning parameter of the run is a field of `FC_Settings`
(`src/fc_settings.jl`), loaded from `data/fc_settings.yaml` into the global
`fcs`; each field is documented there. A run with different values needs no edit
of this script — define `fcs` first and it is used as-is:

    fcs = FC_Settings("fc_settings.yaml")
    fcs.sim_time = 30.0
    fcs.el_center = 30.0
    include("examples/simple_fig8.jl")

The dated record of how these parameters were arrived at — sweeps, reverted
attempts and the failures behind each closed lever — is in
`docs/fig8_tuning_log.md`. Add new findings there, not here.

# the wind window — is close to the path at every instant and scores a low RMS d.

# into the average on a slow entry and drop pattern samples on a fast one.
# The mean is the value `v_app_ref` should be set to — it anchors the 1/v_app
# gain schedule, and only when it matches the speed actually flown does
# `heading_p` read as the gain the kite really flies at (see `FC_Settings`). The
# applied gain is `heading_p * v_app_ref / v_app` either way, so a mismatch
