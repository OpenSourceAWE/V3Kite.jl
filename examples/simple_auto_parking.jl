Example script demonstrating an ATTITUDE-STABILIZED parking maneuver of the V3
kite using the high-level `init` + `step!` interface.

Same setup as `examples/simple_parking.jl` — the wing is settled at a fixed
depower setting (DEPOWER_SETPOINT) and parked at a constant tether length
(`step!` runs in POSITION MODE via `set_length`) — but instead of leaving the
steering at zero, a heading PID (as in `examples/simple_sinus.jl`) regulates
the heading to a constant setpoint of zero, so the kite does not drift away
from straight-up parking.

Gain scheduling: the kite's turn rate is roughly proportional to
`u_s * v_app`, so the controller gain is scheduled with `1/v_app`:

    K = HEADING_P * V_APP_REF / v_app

`HEADING_P` is therefore the gain that applies at `v_app == V_APP_REF`, and
the closed-loop response stays roughly invariant when the apparent wind speed
changes. Because `DiscretePID` is in standard form (`K*(e + ...)`), scaling `K`
scales the D action along with it.

Logs the run to "tmp_auto_parking". For verification, run
`include("examples/simple_auto_parking.jl")` and check the printed heading
regulation RMS error.

At the end it also prints the AoA ripple metrics (see `src/ripple_metrics.jl` and
PlanSuppressOscillations.md) together with the solver cost and the wall clock, as
`examples/simple_parking.jl` does, so a change to e.g. the body-frame damping can
be judged on both the oscillation and the simulation speed. Those numbers are
only comparable across runs that fix PROJECT, V_WIND, TETHER_LENGTH,
DEPOWER_SETPOINT, the heading gains, SIM_TIME and DT.
