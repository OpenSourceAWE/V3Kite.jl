# Plant/controller adapter. V3Kite is the PLANT: `step!` takes a winch TORQUE,
# because that is what the drum takes. Holding a LENGTH is a control problem —
# it needs a cascaded loop with its own gains, saturations and state — so that
# controller lives in WinchControllers.jl and is the CALLER's to own, exactly as
# `KiteModels.jl`'s `next_step!` takes only speed/torque/force.
#
# The glue between the two is this file: it reads the plant scalars off a
# `V3KITE` and hands them to WinchControllers' scalar-only functions. It belongs
# to the application, not to either package — V3Kite must not depend on a
# controller, and WinchControllers must not depend on a kite model.
#
# Used by V3Kite's own examples and tests. `include` it and construct a
# controller once per run:
#
#     wcs = WCSettings(dt = s.dt)          # or WC_Settings("wc_settings.yaml")
#     wpc = WinchPosController(wcs; dt = s.dt)
#     step!(s; rel_depower, set_torque = winch_torque!(wpc, s, l0))

    load_wc_settings(filename; dt) -> WCSettings

Load winch-controller settings from the YAML file `filename`, looked up under
the active data path (`joinpath(get_data_path(), filename)`) unless absolute.
The file must have a top-level `wc_settings:` mapping whose keys are fields of
`WCSettings`; a missing key keeps the struct default, an unknown key errors.

This used to be V3Kite's own `WC_Settings(filename)`. It lives here now because
the struct belongs to WinchControllers.jl and the *file* belongs to the run —
V3Kite itself no longer reads winch gains at all. `dt` always wins over the
file's placeholder value: it is the plant's timestep, not a tuning choice.

Run WinchControllers.jl's cascaded length loop against `s` and return the winch
torque [N·m] for `step!`'s `set_torque`. Replaces the `set_length` keyword
`step!` used to carry before the winch controllers moved out of V3Kite.

`acceleration_limit` comes from the plant's own `winch: max_acc:`
([`winch_acc_limit`](@ref)), which is what `step!` defaulted it to. `v_ff` [m/s]
is the speed feed-forward: a caller integrating a speed setpoint into
`set_length` should pass that same speed, or the outer P loop has to rediscover
it from a length error at a cost of `1/kp_pos` of lag.
