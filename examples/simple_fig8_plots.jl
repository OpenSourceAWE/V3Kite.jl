Plotting for simple_fig8.jl results.

Loads the "fig8_run" log saved by simple_fig8.jl. Produces three figures:

1. the flown pattern in the (azimuth, elevation) plane against the reference
   lemniscate — the plot that shows at a glance whether the pattern is being
   flown or only approximated. The attractor track (`var_02`/`var_03`) is
   deliberately NOT drawn: it hugs the reference path by construction, so it
   added a third near-coincident curve and obscured the two that matter;
2. a stacked time-series figure: cross-track error, elevation (with the pattern
   centre), heading and course vs the commanded course, the course-tracking
   error, steering command vs the KCU's actual tape-lagged value, tether force,
   and tether length against the length setpoint. The last two belong together:
   at `COMPLIANCE > 0` the drum holds a low-passed force rather than a length,
   so it pays out on every dive and hauls in on every climb, and the length
   panel is where that shows — the excursion scales with `COMPLIANCE` itself.
   The setpoint line is the length at `t = 0`, which is exactly the `l0` the run
   trims back to (both come from the first logged row). At `COMPLIANCE = 0` the
   two lines should sit on top of each other to within a centimetre;
3. an aerodynamics figure: angle of attack and lift-to-drag ratio, with the
   apparent wind speed and the kite speed `|vel_kite|` underneath to read both
   against. Those two speeds are plotted in one panel on purpose: they differ by
   roughly the wind speed, and `|vel_kite|` is the signal the heading/course
   blend is scheduled on, so this is where a mid-manoeuvre crossing of the
   `V_KITE_HEADING`/`V_KITE_COURSE` band shows up.

The AoA panel carries two curves because they answer different questions.
`AoA` is the VSM's CENTRE PANEL angle, the one `update_sys_state!` logs; the
span-mean (`var_09`, written by simple_fig8.jl) averages every panel. They
agree while the wing is loaded symmetrically and separate in a turn, where
steering twists the two halves the opposite way — so their gap is a direct read
on how hard the wing is being worked, which matters here because the steering
sits on its clamp for most of the pattern. Logs written before `var_09` existed
show that curve as a flat zero.

The L/D panel likewise shows two: `var_15` is the wing alone and `var_16` the
effective value with tether, bridle and KCU drag included (both filled by
`step!`). The second is what actually sets the achievable speed. A GAP in
either curve is not missing data: `step!` writes `NaN` whenever the drag drops
below `drag_floor`, i.e. while the wing is unloaded and the ratio would be a
vanishing force divided into itself. Logs written before that guard existed
show those instants as a spike instead.

The guidance commands a COURSE (direction of travel) while the inner loop
regulates HEADING (where the nose points), so the angle panel shows all three:
`chi` is what the kite actually flew, `chi_set` the command, and the
`chi - psi` gap is the kite's drift angle (~13° on the V3, see
`src/fig8_controller.jl`). Those three are plotted UNWRAPPED (a lap of the
pattern crosses ±180°, and the raw traces jump there); the error panel below
carries the same errors wrapped to ±180°.

Judge path following by `chi - chi_set`. The third curve in the error panel is
the error the PID actually regulated (`var_06`): the loop feeds back heading at
low kite speed and course at high, blending in between
(`V_KITE_HEADING`/`V_KITE_COURSE` in simple_fig8.jl, weight logged in `var_08`),
so that curve rides on `psi - chi_set` at low speed and on `chi - chi_set` at
high. On logs written before the blend existed it coincides with
`psi - chi_set`.
